# Grading-system
This is a C++ console-based grading system that calculates a student's grade based on their marks in seven subjects. Five subjects have a maximum of 100 marks, while two subjects have a maximum of 50 marks. The program calculates the total marks obtained, percentage, and final grade based on standard grading criteria.
